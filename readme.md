# XibFree - A lightweight, code-only layout engine for iOS/MonoTouch

See <http://www.toptensoftware.com/xibfree/> for more information.

The TopTenSoftware package has been extended with the following functionality:
- Generic Native View, which also has connected properties to the encapsulated uiview.
- Auto resizing option that responds to changed visibility (Visible and Gone properties of a View).
- A webview component that automatically resizes the container to fit the contents. The scrolling then is handled by the parent container instead of the UIWebView itself.

Thanks, TopTenSoftware, for this wonderful XibFree base you have created. 

Regards,

Hugo Logmans
